## 🚀 what I do
- Build full-stack apps using modern web technologies  
- Design APIs, microservices, authentication flows, and integrations  
- Work across frontend, backend, mobile, and cloud  
- Clean up legacy systems and make them actually maintainable  
- Spend 8 hours automating stuff that takes 5 minutes manually

I enjoy mixing creativity + engineering: building stuff that’s fun to use, pleasant to maintain, and scales without crying.

## 🌱 fun facts
- I'm a musician and composer. 
- I play guitar and bass and can read sheet music.
- The profile username is a combiation of mishearing the lyrics of a song from Heroes del Silencio as a kid and an old username I saw very often in MUGEN forums as a teenager.
