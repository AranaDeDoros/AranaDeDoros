## fun facts
- I'm a musician and composer too. 
- I play guitar and bass and can read sheet music (to some extent).
- The profile username is a combination of mishearing the lyrics of a Heroes del Silencio's song as a kid and an old username I saw very often in MUGEN forums as a teenager.
- I can read japanese.
