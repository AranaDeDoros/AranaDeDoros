## 🚀 what I do

- Spend 8 hours automating stuff that takes 5 minutes manually

I enjoy mixing creativity + engineering: building stuff that’s fun to create.

## 🌱 fun facts
- I'm a musician and composer too. 
- I play guitar and bass and can read sheet music (to some extent).
- The profile username is a combination of mishearing the lyrics of a song from Heroes del Silencio as a kid and an old username I saw very often in MUGEN forums as a teenager.
- I can read japanese.
